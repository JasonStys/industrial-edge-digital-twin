# CodeQL analysis and findings review

By Jason Stys. This is source analysis for an educational repository, not security certification or
permission to connect to equipment.

## Setup diagnosis

The authenticated current-main findings/analyses API previously returned HTTP404 with
`no analysis found`. Inspection of the public repository and its active workflow list confirmed
there was no CodeQL workflow or uploaded analysis. Existing CI and dependency/security jobs were
real, separate gates; their success did not establish CodeQL coverage. GitHub supports code scanning
for public repositories without purchasing a private-organization feature. No broader account
permission, default-setup toggle or alert suppression was required to add advanced setup.

## Supported language and build inventory

| Language lane                  | Extraction and actual scope                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `c-cpp` / manual               | Initialize CodeQL, configure a fresh CMake/Ninja Release tree, then compile every declared engine/library/test target under tracing and run CTest. No previously built binary can stand in for extraction. |
| `javascript-typescript` / none | Authored gateway, HMI, tests and JavaScript tooling; no transpiled bundle is substituted for TypeScript source.                                                                                            |
| `actions` / none               | Repository workflow YAML and expression/security patterns.                                                                                                                                                 |

The language choices follow the official
[supported languages](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/concepts/code-scanning/codeql/codeql-code-scanning),
[compiled-language modes](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/reference/code-scanning/codeql/build-options-for-compiled-languages),
and
[query suites](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/how-tos/find-and-fix-code-vulnerabilities/manage-your-configuration/customizing-your-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning).

## Workflow security contract

`.github/workflows/codeql.yml` runs on main pushes, pull requests targeting main, an explicit weekly
schedule and manual dispatch. It uses no `pull_request_target`, secrets, deployment, hardware access
or mutation of old releases. Top-level contents permission is read-only; only the analysis job
additionally requests `security-events: write` to upload its genuine SARIF. Checkout does not
persist credentials. Public dependencies/query packs require no package-write or identity token.

All action references use full40-character source commits. The reviewed CodeQL action is4.39.3 at
`33d7b85da1a04171e211befe2c739303b9a4c066`, independently resolved from GitHub's annotated release
tag. Init and analyze use the same pin and `security-extended`; no query exclusions, blanket path
ignores, advisory ignores, suppression baseline or `continue-on-error` is added. Each lane has
a25-minute timeout and separate language category. Trap/dependency caches are disabled for this new
workflow rather than adding storage or changing existing cache/retention policies.

## Reading results correctly

A successful job means the scanner completed; it does not imply no alerts. After merge, verify the
actual main ref SHA, the complete open-alert listing filtered to `refs/heads/main`, and an
error-free rule-bearing CodeQL analysis at that same SHA. Separate language categories make
extraction coverage visible. An HTTP403/404, incomplete listing, missing category or older analysis
is unavailable/incomplete evidence, never zero clearance. A PR analysis belongs to the PR/merge ref
and must not be represented as a completed main analysis.

Investigate a reported path and line in the real input-to-sink flow, reproduce a reachable issue
with an independent negative test, fix the boundary, then rerun its existing tests and actual
CodeQL. This project does not automatically dismiss findings or require a false zero result.
Preserve every existing compiler, runtime, sanitizer, browser and dependency gate.

## Reproduction and limits

Run the existing commands in [testing](testing.md). Validate workflow syntax with a reviewed
actionlint release. Genuine CodeQL extraction/query execution occurs in the hosted workflow; local
YAML parsing, successful builds and zero known dependency advisories are separate observations.
GitHub's language/framework models can miss custom boundaries; none of these checks proves absence
of vulnerabilities or operational safety. See
[the setup validation report](reports/codeql-setup-2026-11-09.md).
