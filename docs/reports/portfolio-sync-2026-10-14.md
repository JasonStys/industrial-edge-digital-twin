# Portfolio synchronization — 2026-10-14

Created by Jason Stys.

This candidate combines the reviewed proposals below while preserving their commit ancestry and the
existing main-branch security fixes. Conflicting version declarations are combined explicitly;
affected locks are regenerated from the reviewed manifests. No audit or coverage budget is lowered.

- [Original proposal #4](https://github.com/JasonStys/industrial-edge-digital-twin/pull/4).
- [Original proposal #8](https://github.com/JasonStys/industrial-edge-digital-twin/pull/8).
- [Original proposal #9](https://github.com/JasonStys/industrial-edge-digital-twin/pull/9).

Coordinated CodeQL steps use the same reviewed immutable release where present. Source and
generated-symbol contracts remain enforced by the existing workflows. The complete candidate must
pass its applicable native CI before promotion.

This maintenance does not add production deployments, user-data access, automatic source promotion
or new guarantees of security. Existing release tags and assets are retained. Platform and
model-quality limitations remain in the project README.
